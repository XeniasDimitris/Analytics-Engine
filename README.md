# SmartX-Project

## Summary
  This project aims to creat a dashboard for descriptive analytics of Aarhus Datasets. Even though we could use tools like Tableau for our job, in this project we will create from scratch such a tool in a server-client web-based application.
 
 ## Datasets
  Our Data are related to air pollution, weather, traffic, parking and DOKK1's sensors measurements. More about datasets in **Datasets_Presentation.pdf** file.
  
 ## Architecture
 
  We are using ArrangoDB for our database, django framework for the server and ReactJS for the application following a RESTful API architecture with a MVC model.
